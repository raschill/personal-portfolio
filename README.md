## About Me

### A word that defines my career is versatility. I have found success in a variety of fields and been blessed with many different experiences. These propel me into each new project with unique insight and passion for discovery.

### I have travelled the world and found opportunities in everything from technology to fine art. The thread that connects each of these seemingly unrelated fields is my endless thirst for creativity. Whether through artistic expression or creative problem solving, I am most fulfilled when I get to breathe life into something new. Bringing ideas from a concept on paper to an actual real life thing fills me with the greatest joy.

## Work Experience

### In tech, I have had the pleasure of working for id Software on projects like Doom: Eternal and Doom 2016. I served in a QA testing capacity and was fortunate to have opportunities to lead small teams on occasion. I have also had the opportunity to work with pyrotechnics, from fireworks to cryo effects and everything in between. Whether hands on in the field or behind a desk, I excel at finding problems and working towards solutions.

### In the arts, I specialize in costume design and running tech for live theater performances. I have served in every ladder up the rung from lead designer to wardrobe crew member. I have assisted both lighting and scenic crews, and I have some experience with building and designing props. I don't care for the stage itself, but I am a crucial part of any backstage team.

## Past Projects

### I am just starting out my programming journey. The most I've done right now is build a little fan page in http.

### Someday soon, I hope to report much more impressive feats!
